# Genre Model Placeholder
# This file serves as a placeholder for the trained genre classification model.
# 
# To use this service, you need to place the following trained model files in this directory:
# - music_genre_model.h5: Your trained Keras/TensorFlow CNN model.
# - scaler.pkl: The MinMaxScaler used to scale the spectrogram data during training.
# - label_encoder.pkl: The LabelEncoder that maps genre indices to genre names.
#
# Expected genre classes (as per the trained LabelEncoder):
# 0: blues
# 1: classical
# 2: country
# 3: disco
# 4: hiphop
# 5: jazz
# 6: metal
# 7: pop
# 8: reggae
# 9: rock
#
# Model Input Shape:
# The model expects input shape: (batch_size, 210, 210, 1) for Mel Spectrogram features.
# 
# Training Details:
# - The model was trained on Mel Spectrograms generated from audio chunks.
# - Each spectrogram was resized to a fixed shape of (210, 210) before being fed into the model.
# - A MinMaxScaler was fitted on the training data to scale pixel values between 0 and 1.
# - Ensure any new data processed for prediction undergoes the exact same preprocessing steps.
